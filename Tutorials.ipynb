        "*Internode*: The result of growth of a branch, between two nodes. Internodes are represented by cylinders with a fixed width but variable length.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Node*: What is left after a meristem produces a new organ (it separates internodes). They contain no data or geometry (so also a point) but are required to keep the branching structure of the tree as well as connecting leaves. \n",
        "\n",

        "*BudNode*: The node left by a bud after it has been activated. They contain no data or geometry but they change the orientation of the turtle.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Leaf*: These are the nodes associated to leaves in the TreeTypes. They are represented by ellipses with a particular orientation and insertion angle. The insertion angle is assumed constant, but the orientation angle varies according to an elliptical phyllotaxis rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this first simple model, only internodes grow over time according to a relative growth rate, whereas leaves are assumed to be of fixed sized determined at their creation. For simplicity, all active meristems will produce an phytomer (combination of node, internode, leaves and buds) per time step. Bud break is assumed stochastic, with a probability that increases proportional to the number of phytomers from the apical meristem (up to 1). In the following tutorials, these assumptions are replaced by more realistic models of light interception, photosynthesis, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to simulate growth of the 3D binary tree, we need to define a parameter describing the relative rate at which each internode elongates in each iteration of the simulation, a coefficient to compute the probability of bud break as well as the insertion and orientation angles of the leaves. We could stored these values as global constants, but VPL offers to opportunity to store them per plant. This makes it easier to manage multiple plants in the same simulation that may belong to different species, cultivars, ecotypes or simply to simulate plant-to-plant variation. Graphs in VPL can store an object of any user-defined type that will me made accessible to graph rewriting rules and queries. For this example, we define a data type `treeparams` that holds the relevant parameters. We use `Base.@kwdef` to assign default values to all parameters and allow to assign them by name."

When a bud breaks, it is replaced by a bud node, an internode and a new meristem. This new meristem becomes the apical meristem of the new branch, such that `meristem_rule` would apply. Note how we create an external function to compute whether a bud breaks or not. This is useful to keep the `branch_rule` rule simple and readable, while allow for a relatively complex bud break model.
