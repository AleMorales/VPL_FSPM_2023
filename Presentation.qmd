# The Virtual Plant Laboratory (VPL)

## What is VPL?

* A **package** written in the Julia language  
* The **API** offers **data structures** and **algorithms** to help you build, simulate and visualize FSP models 
    * Development is driven by the needs of our research  
    * Plant-level models where functionality is defined at the organ and plant level  
    * Emphasis on plant-plant and plant-environment interactions
    * Crop systems (vertical farming, greenhouse, mono- and intercropping, perennials)

## What is the *VPLverse*?

* VPL + website + other packages

* Optional **packages** to help build FSP models:  
    * **Sky.jl** to solar radiation and generate light sources for ray tracing    
    * **Ecophys.jl** that contains modules for ecophysiological processes  
    * **VPLTutorials** with examples and tutorials on how to use VPL

* A website with all the documentation and tutorials on VPLverse

## What VPL will never be

* A Julia implementation of other FSPM software
* A modelling language
* A large model with lots of plugins
* A standalone modelling studio/platform
* An attempt to support every possible FSP model  

## Why not a standalone studio?

When building an studio/platform you are responsible for:  

* Platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux...)  
* Visualization (3D rendering, graphs)   
* Input (text editor)  
* Code organization (projects)  
* Graphical user interface to organize input/output (GUI)  

Since VPL is just a Julia package we get (most of) this for “free”

How do I do X in VPL = How do I do X in Julia (in most cases)

## Why not a modelling language?

Domain specific languages have advantages:  

* Succinct and powerful in describing elaborate computations 
* Can generate optimized code  
* The user can avoid learning technical details or even progranming 

And disadvantages:

* It can be more limiting than an API-based approach  
* The code being executed is not visible to the user  (*magic* happening in the background, many assumptions being made)    
* A new language requires its own development support (syntax highlighting, code completion, Github copilot? GPT?, etc.)    
* The user needs to learn the domain specific language which is not useful for anything else  

## Why am I building VPL?

* I wanted to have an FSPM platform where I could:

    * Use it as part of a reproducible computing workflow for plotting, I/O, analysis...  
    * Easily extend it without touching the source code     
    * Read the source code and understand what is going on  
    * Read the documentation and understand how it works  
    * Use it to teach FSPM to students  
    * Run it anywhere (Windows, Mac, Linux, HPC, Cloud, etc.)

## What is Julia?

* A dynamic JIT compiled programming language
* Julia 0.0 beta released in 2012 by 4 people @ MIT
* Julia 1.0 in 2018 (stable since then)
* Reads like Matlab-Python, feels like R, runs like C
* It is very easy to integrate with R and Python, native support for C/C++

## Why Julia?

* Classic dynamic languages (R, Python, Matlab)
    * Rapid development
    * Easy to learn
    * Code runs slow
* Two language problem: Bottlenecks lowered to classic static languages (C/C++/Fortran)
    * Need to maintain code in two languages, plus the interface
    * To really benefit, most of the FSPM would have to be lowered
* Julia was designed to solve the two language problem
    * Write all the code in a single language
    * Achieve performance by incrementally improving the code

# VPL design

## VPL overview

VPL addresses four main components in FSPM:

- **Graphs** to represent the topology of the plants  
    - Inspired by Relational Growth Grammars (GroIMP) but procedural  
- **Geometry** to represent the 3D structure of the plants plus other scene elements 
    - Inspired by turtle graphics and based on triangular meshes compatible with other Julia packages  
- Interactive **3D visualization** of the structure  
    - Based on Makie.jl (support OpenGL and WebGL) 
- Radiation transport within the scene
    - Multi-threaded, multi-wavelength **Monte Carlo ray tracer** 

## Graphs

- A tree graph represents **topology** of a plant (nodes, internodes, leaves, etc.)

- A node can store any **user-defined data type** (`<: Node`) as well as the graph itself (`vars`)

- Each data type has a method that defines its **geometry, material and color** (`feed!`)

- Graph edges created by a simply **node algebra**:
    - Phytomer: `Node() + (Bud(), Leaf()) + Internode() + Meristem() `

- User defines functions to implement:

    - **Relational growth rules** can replace nodes by subgraphs (`Rule` & `rewrite!`)

    - **Relational queries** can extract combinations of nodes (`Query` & `apply`)

- Different graphs can be queried/rewritten in **parallel** (multi-threading)

## Geometry

- A `Scene` contains
    - 3D **triangular mesh** 
    - Optional **colors** (for rendering)
    - Optional **materials** (for ray tracing)

- Scenes are created from graphs using `feed!`

- Individual elements can be added to the scene manually (`add!`)

- Mesh constructors are provided for common shapes (cylinder, rectangle, etc.)

- Meshes can be exported/imported to/from other formats (e.g. OBJ, STL, PLY)

## Visualization

- Graphs can be rendered as **networks diagrams** and labels can be customized

- Scenes can be rendered with a simple **3D interactive engine**

- All visualization based on Makie.jl that supports OpenGL and WebGL

- Snapshots can be exported

## Ray tracing

- Multi-threaded, multi-wavelength forward **Monte Carlo ray tracer**

- **Acceleration** with SAH-based Bounding Volume Hierarchy

- Common **radiation sources** are available (point, directional, area, line)

- Common **materials** are available (Black, Sensor, Lambertian, Modified Phong)

- Users can add new materials and light sources and choose the number generator (not documented yet)

- **Sky.jl** creates light sources for diffuse and direct solar radiation from location and day of year

- Use instancing to approximate large canopies (**grid cloner**)

- Could have multiple ray tracers in the same model

# Future roadmap

## Short term

- Finish tutorials
- Develop reference models and extend Ecophys.jl and Sky.jl 
- Technical documentation for developers  
- Avoid forced dependency on OpenGL/X11  
- Move rendering and raytracing to separate packages in the VPLverse  
- Prepare package for collaboration and register it  

## Long term

- Plant internal transport via ODEs  
- Interface with environment (soil and atmosphere)  
    - Mapping 3D geometry to a 3D grid  
    - Support PDE models for environment  
- Hybrid light models (e.g. FSPM + MAESPA-like models, Raycaster + radiative transfer)
